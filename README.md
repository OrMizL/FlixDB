# FlixDB - a movies database mockup

This is a demo project, built for practice purposes using the React.js framework.

It's basically a very simple movies database that takes API data and displays it in a well-known UI structure.

Keep in mind that this project was done for education purposes, therefore a lot can be (and maybe should be) improved.

I have some more features ideas, of course, and they might be added over time.

## About the project

The project shows some basic React principles, such as state management, ajax calls and api interaction, react router, using css modules, react hooks and more.

Future features can include some search functionality, accounts creation (autentication), movies bookmarking (watchlist) and also include TV shows.
